# User Roadmap Journey (Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners)

This guide explains, in simple steps, how a user moves through a learning roadmap on our platform.

---

## 1. Enroll in a Roadmap
- The user chooses a roadmap to join.
- The system records that the user is now enrolled in this roadmap.
- The system finds all courses in the roadmap and enrolls the user in the first course automatically.
- The other courses are shown as locked or for preview only.

## 2. Start the First Course
- The user starts the first course.
- The system lists all sections (parts) of the course.
- All sections are locked except the first one, which is unlocked for the user.
- Each section has chapters. Only the first chapter of the first section is unlocked.

## 3. Progress Each Week
- Every week, the system unlocks new sections for the user.
- As the user finishes chapters, their progress is saved.
- When a section is finished, it is marked as complete.
- When all sections are done, the course is marked as complete.

## 4. Submit a Project
- The user submits a project for the course.
- A tutor reviews the project and gives feedback (approved or rejected).

## 5. Complete the Course and Get a Certificate
- If the project is approved, the course is marked as complete.
- The user receives a certificate for the course.

## 6. Move to the Next Course
- The system checks which course is next in the roadmap.
- If there is only one, the user is enrolled automatically.
- If there are several, the user can choose which one to start next.

## 7. Finish the Roadmap
- When all required courses are completed, the roadmap is marked as finished for the user.
